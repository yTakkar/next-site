      <h2>A Happier, More Productive Org</h2>

      <p>
        One year into their journey, Zack credits Next.js for fewer bugs, greater productivity, and
        a happier engineering organization. As Next.js continues to improve, the Hulu team is
        excited to continually reap the rewards, passing them on to their users in the form of a
        more robust, and featureful platform.
