## Adding Link Props

You may need to add attributes or props to your links for a number of reasons. Perhaps you need to add a `title` attribute to the link. We can add it like this:

```js
<Link href="/about">
  <a title="About Page">About Page</a>
</Link>
```

Once we add this, you can see that the rendered anchor tag gets the `title` attribute "About Page" added on to it.

How about doing this instead?

```js
<Link href="/about" title="About Page">
  <a>About Page</a>
</Link>
```

What has happened with the above code change?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
