## Finally

Lazy loading dynamic components are pretty important for a high performing app. It allows you to load components whenever you need to. If you do this wisely, you can reduce the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and make your app load faster.

Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR) for these dynamic components by default. So, you don't lose anything by using dynamic components.

We've only used the basic functionality of dynamic components. You can learn more about them by referring to [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/#dynamic-import).

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
