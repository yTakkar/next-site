import Layout from '~/components/Layout'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Lazy Loading Components',
  courseId: 'excel',
  lessonId: 'lazy-loading-components',
  stepId: 'lazy-loading'
}

As you've seen, the app will download `react-highlight` in the client side when it's needed. That's the whole purpose of dynamic components. While it's loading, it will show a loading component.

You can also set a [custom loading component](https://nextjs.org/docs/#2-with-custom-loading-component) if needed.

### Direct Visit

If you directly visit a page that contains a code snippet (such as http://localhost:3000/p/hello-nextjs), that's a special case. Then the app will load the component in the server side, and it includes the bundle with the initial HTML.

You can verify that by looking into the HTML content of the above-mentioned page.
