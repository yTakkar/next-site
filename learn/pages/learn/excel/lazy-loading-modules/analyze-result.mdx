## Analyze Result

As you have seen, the firebase modules are contained inside the `pages/index.js` and `pages/post.js` bundles.

That is happening because they are loaded by importing the `/lib/load-db.js` file only in those two pages.

If the modules were imported in all pages of our app, they would have been contained inside the `commons[a-random-string].js` bundle.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
