## Let's test it

Now let's try to see how this works in the browser.

For that, we need to run the production version of our app. You can do that with:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

Then, start the app in the browser which has a decent Network inspect debugger.
(To make things simple, I suggest that you should use Chrome)

Now, load <http://localhost:3000> in Chrome and open the Network inspector.

Then, clear the current data in the Network inspector.

> You can click the selected icon with red square in the above image.
> But if the browser version changes, the location might be in a different place.

Now, click on any title listed on the page. Check the Network inspector.
Then, click the “Home” link and go to the index page again. Check the Network inspector.

How do you best describe what you've inspected?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
