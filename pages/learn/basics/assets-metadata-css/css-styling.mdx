Let’s now talk about **CSS styling**.

As you can see, our index page ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) already has some styling. If you take a look at `pages/index.js`, you should see the code like this:

```jsx
<style jsx>{`
  …
`}</style>
```

This is using a library called [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx). It’s a “CSS-in-JS” library — it lets you write CSS within a React component, and the CSS styles will be _scoped_ (other components won’t be affected).

Next.js has built-in support for [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx), but you can also use other popular CSS-in-JS libraries such as [styled-components](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-styled-components) or [emotion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-emotion).

### Writing and Importing CSS

Next.js has built-in support for CSS and Sass which allows you to import `.css` and `.scss` files.

Using popular CSS libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss) is also supported.

In this lesson, we’ll talk about how to write and import CSS files in Next.js. We’ll also talk about Next.js’s built-in support for [CSS Modules](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css) and [Sass](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support). Let’s dive in!

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
