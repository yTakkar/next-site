import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Assets, Metadata, and CSS',

}

The second page we added currently does not have styling. Let's add some CSS to style the page.

Next.js has built-in support for [CSS](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) and [Sass](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support). For the purposes of this course we will use CSS.

This lesson will also talk about how Next.js handles static assets like images and page metadata like `title` tags.

In this lesson, you’ll learn:
