First, let’s make sure that your development environment is ready.

- If you don’t have **Node.js** installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/). You’ll need Node.js version **10** or later.
- You’ll be using your own text editor and terminal app for this tutorial.

> If you are on Windows, we recommend [downloading Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and use Git Bash that comes with it, which supports the UNIX-specific commands in this tutorial.

### Create a Next.js app

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, `cd` into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:

```bash
npm init next-app nextjs-blog
```

Then choose the **Default starter app** template.

```bash
❯  Default starter app
```

> Under the hood, this uses the tool called `create-next-app`, which bootstraps a Next.js app for you.

### Run the development server

You now have a new directory called `nextjs-blog`. Let’s `cd` into it:

```bash
cd nextjs-blog
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts your Next.js app’s "development server" (more on this later) on port **3000**.

Let’s check to see if it’s working. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) from your browser.

**Question**: What text do you see on the page?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
