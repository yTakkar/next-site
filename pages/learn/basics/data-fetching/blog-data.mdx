import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Pre-rendering and Data Fetching',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'data-fetching',
  stepId: 'blog-data',
  subtitle: 'Blog Data'
}

We’ll now add blog data to our app using the file system. Each blog post will be a markdown file.

- Create a new top-level directory called **`posts`** (this is not the same as `pages/posts`).
- Inside, create two files: **`pre-rendering.md`** and **`ssg-ssr.md`**.

Copy the following to `pre-rendering.md`:

```md
---
title: 'Two Forms of Pre-rendering'
date: '2020-01-01'
---

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
```

Copy the following to `ssg-ssr.md`:

```md
---
title: 'When to Use Static Generation v.s. Server-side Rendering'
date: '2020-01-02'
---

We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
```

> You might have noticed that each markdown file has a metadata section at the top containing `title` and `date`. This is called YAML Front Matter, which can be parsed using a library called [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter).

### Parsing the Blog Data on `getStaticProps`

Now, let’s update our index page (`pages/index.js`) using this data. We’d like to:

- Parse each markdown file and get `title`, `date`, and file name (which will be used as `id` for the post URL).
- List the data on the index page, sorted by date.

To do this on pre-render, we need to implement [`getStaticProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation).

<Image
  shadow
  alt="Index Page"
  oversize={false}
  src="/static/images/learn/data-fetching/index-page.png"
  width={1246 / 2}
  height={948 / 2}
/>

Let’s do it on the next page!

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
