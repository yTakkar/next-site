import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout'

  stepId: 'getstaticprops-details',
  subtitle: 'getStaticProps Details'
}

Here is some essential information you should know about [`getStaticProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation).

### Fetch External API or Query Database

In `lib/posts.js`, we’ve implemented `getSortedPostsData` which fetches data from the file system. But you can fetch the data from other sources, like an external API endpoint, and it’ll work just fine:

```js
import fetch from 'node-fetch'

export async function getSortedPostsData() {
  // Instead of the file system,
  // fetch post data from an external API endpoint
  const res = await fetch('..')
  return res.json()
}
```

You can also query the database directly:

```js
import someDatabaseSDK from 'someDatabaseSDK'

const databaseClient = someDatabaseSDK.createClient(...)

export async function getSortedPostsData() {
  // Instead of the file system,
  // fetch post data from a database
  return databaseClient.query('SELECT posts...')
}
```

This is possible because [`getStaticProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) runs **only on the server-side**. It will never run on the client-side. It won’t even be included in the JS bundle for the browser. That means you can write code such as direct database queries without them being sent to browsers.

### Development vs. Production

- In **development** (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`), [`getStaticProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) runs on _every request_.
- In **production**, [`getStaticProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) runs at _build time_.

Because it’s meant to be run at build time, you won’t be able to use data that’s only available during request time, such as query parameters or HTTP headers.

### Only Allowed in a Page

[`getStaticProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) can only be exported from a [**page**](/docs/basic-features/pages). You can’t export it from non-page files.

One of the reasons for this restriction is that React needs to have all the required data before the page is rendered.

### What If I Need to Fetch Data at Request Time?

[Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In cases like this, you can try [**Server-side Rendering**](/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) or skip pre-rendering. Let’s talk about these strategies before we move on to the next lesson.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
