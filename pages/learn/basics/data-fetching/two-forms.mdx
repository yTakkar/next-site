  subtitle: 'Two Forms of Pre-rendering'
}

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: [**Static Generation**](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) and [**Server-side Rendering**](/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering). The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- [**Static Generation**](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- [**Server-side Rendering**](/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

> In development mode (when you run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`), every page is [pre-rendered](/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering) on each request — even for pages that use [Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended).

### Per-page Basis

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using [Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) for most pages and using [Server-side Rendering](/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) for others.

### When to Use [Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) v.s. [Server-side Rendering](/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering)

We recommend using [**Static Generation**](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use [Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose [Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended).

On the other hand, [Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use [**Server-side Rendering**](/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering). It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate frequently updated data.

### We’ll Focus on Static Generation

In this lesson, we’ll focus on [Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended). On the next page, we’ll talk about [Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) **with and without data**.
