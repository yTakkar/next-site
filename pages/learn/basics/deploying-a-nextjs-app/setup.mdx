  stepId: 'setup'
};

## Setup

First of all, we need a Next.js app to play with. Download the following example app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeit/next-learn-demo.git
cd next-learn-demo
cd 8-deploying
```

You can preview the application in development mode by running:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can press <kbd>ctrl + c</kbd> in your terminal to stop the development server when you're ready to move on.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
