Next.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js.

If youâ€™ve followed the instructions so far, your `package.json` should have `build` and `start` scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

In your own hosting provider, run the `build` script once, which builds the production application in the `.next` folder.

```shell
npm run build
```

After building, the `start` script starts a Node.js server that supports hybrid pages, serving both statically generated and server-side rendered pages, and API Routes.

```shell
npm run start
```

> **Tip**: You can customize the `start` script in `package.json` to accept a `PORT` parameter by updating it as: `"start": "next start -p $PORT"`.

Thatâ€™s it! If you have questions about deploying Next.js, you can ask our community on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions).
