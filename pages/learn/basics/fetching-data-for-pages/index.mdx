import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {
  title: 'Fetching Data for Pages',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'fetching-data-for-pages'
};

Now we know how to create a pretty decent Next.js app and get the full advantage of the Next.js routing API.

In practice, we usually need to fetch data from a remote data source. Next.js comes with a standard API to fetch data for pages. We do it using an async function called `getInitialProps`.

> `getInitialProps` can only be added to the default component exported by a page, adding it to any other component won't work.

With `getInitialProps`, we can fetch data for a given page via a remote data source and pass it as props to our page. `getInitialProps` needs to work on both server and client; since it is called in both environments.

In this lesson, using `getInitialProps`, we are going to build an app which shows information about Batman TV Shows, utilising the public [TVmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api).

Let's get started.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
