## The Component Directory

Yes. It will work as expected.

We don't need to put our components in a special directory; the directory can be named anything. The only special directories are `/pages` and `/static`.

You can even create the Component inside the `pages` directory.

Here we didn't do that because we don't need a direct URL to our Header component.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
