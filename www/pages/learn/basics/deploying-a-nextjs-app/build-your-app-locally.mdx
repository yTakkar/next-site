## Build Your App Locally

▲ZEIT Now will build your app inside it's build infrastructure.

But, not every hosting provider will have something like that.
In that case, you can build your app locally with:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then deploy the app with the `.next` directory.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
