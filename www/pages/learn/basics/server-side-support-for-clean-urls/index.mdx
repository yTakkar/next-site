import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {
  title: 'Server Side Support for Clean URLs',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'server-side-support-for-clean-urls'
};

In the previous lesson, we learned how to create clean URLs for our app. Basically, we can have URLs like this:

http://localhost:3000/p/my-blog-post

But it only worked with client side navigations. When we reload page, it gives us a 404 page.
That's because there is no actual page called `p/my-blog-post` in the pages directory.

We can solve this pretty easily with the [Next.js custom server API](https://nextjs.org/docs/#custom-server-and-routing).
Let's see how we can do it.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
