## Server Side Rendering

Let's add a new page called `pages/agent.js` that uses SSR to retrieve the user agent:

```jsx
const Agent = ({ userAgent }) => <h1>Your user agent is: {userAgent}</h1>;

Agent.getInitialProps = async ({ req }) => {
  const userAgent = req ? req.headers['user-agent'] : navigator.userAgent;
  return { userAgent };
};

export default Agent;
```

Our new page is very similar to `pages/index.js` but now we're also adding `getInitialProps`, which will add dynamic data to the page before render.

Now let's build our app again:

```bash
npm run build
```

What happened in the compilation of `about.js`?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
